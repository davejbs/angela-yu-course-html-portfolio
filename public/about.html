<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m just your friendly neighborhood code wrangler who talks to computers more than people (they're less judgmental). 
   I spend my days making pixels behave, turning coffee into code, and pretending I know what I'm doing...so far, it's working.
   If I'm not debugging my life or my projects, I'm probably daydreaming about horsepower, synth solos, or that one bug that mysteriously fixed itself (won't complain about that).
   Let’s just say I’m a work in progress now with dark mode enabled.</p>
